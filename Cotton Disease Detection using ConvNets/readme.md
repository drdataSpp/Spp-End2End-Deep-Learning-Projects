# Cotton Disease Detection using ConvNets

### Description
This AI-based web application project was built to detect diseases and pests in cotton plants and leaves. A *convolutional neural network model* was used here to detect the cotton diseases and pests. A frontend web app was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Both, the CNN model and Web application was integrated using the flask framework. 

### How to use this App?
- Upload a cotton plant's image or cotton plant's leaf image
- The deep learning model will predict whether the plant or leaf is affected by disease or not

### How the App looks?
