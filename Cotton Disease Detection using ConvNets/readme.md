### Description
This AI-based web application project was built to detect diseases and pests in cotton plants and leaves. A *convolutional neural network model* was used here to detect the cotton diseases and pests. A frontend web app was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Both, the CNN model and Web application was integrated using the flask framework.
