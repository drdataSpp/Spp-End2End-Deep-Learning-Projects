# End to End Deep Learning Projects by *Soorya Parthiban*
This repository contains End to End Deep Learning projects built using Python on Flask Framework.

## Project 1: Gender Classification using ConvNets
### Description
This AI-based web application project was built to classify male and female using their images. A *convolutional neural network model* was used here to classify the images. A frontend web app was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Both, the CNN model and Web application was integrated using the flask framework. 

### How the App looks?

## Project 2: Malaria Cells Detection using ConvNets
### Description
This AI-based web application project was built to detect malaria parasite cells in blood smear images. A *convolutional neural network model* was used here to detect the malaria cells. A frontend web app was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Both, the CNN model and Web application was integrated using the flask framework.

## Project 3: Cotton Disease Detection using ConvNets
### Description
This AI-based web application project was built to detect diseases and pests in cotton plants and leaves. A *convolutional neural network model* was used here to detect the cotton diseases and pests. A frontend web app was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Both, the CNN model and Web application was integrated using the flask framework.
