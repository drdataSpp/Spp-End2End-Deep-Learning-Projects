### Web App Description
This AI-based web application project was built to detect malaria parasite cells in blood smear images. A *convolutional neural network model* was used here to detect the malaria parasite in microscopic blood samples . A frontend web app was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Both, the CNN model and Web application was integrated using the flask framework. 

### How the App looks?
